                            are as close to the 0-1 range as possible
      --normalize_indices   Goes through all triangle sets, changing all index
                            values to go from 1 to N, replacing sources to be size
                            N
      --make_atlases        Makes a texture atlas with the textures referenced in
                            the given file. Extremely conservative: will only make

                            (0,1). Atlas can be saved with --save_collada_zip.
      --split_triangle_texcoords
                            Splits triangles that span multiple texcoords into
                            multiple triangles to better help texture atlasing
      --optimize_sources    Compresses sources to unique values, updating
                            triangleset indices
